# Scheduling Problems
Round-robin (RR) 

11. COnsider 4 jobs arrive at the scheduler at time 0 with the following burst (run time) requirements: 
  J_1(10), J_2(15), J_3(20), J_4(8)
. If RR is used as CPU scheduling policy, what would be the completion time?
  A: Assume RR quantum of 5us, at t=5us, interrupt J_1. Noted as J_1(5), the number in bracket indicates how much time left.
  the timeline is going to be:
J_1(5), J_2(10), J_3(15), J_4(3), J_1(0), J_2(5), J_3(10), J_4(0) (Finishes at t=38, relinquish the CPU), J_2(0), J_3(5), J_3(0)
  
Disadvantage of having short time quantum: loss of efficiency.
Shorter time quantum -> lose efficiency
Longer time quantum -> less fain, towards FCFS. 

14. Multilevel feedback. One thing to remember: State all assumptions.
  top level queue has time quantum of 1, next level queue 2 units. following one with 4 units. 
  Last queue uses FIFO as scheduling discipline. 
  
  complete theh current job and then switch to the top level queue. 
  Say J_1 has quantum of 2 in level 2, and it gets interrupted or preempted by a job in level 1 after 1us
  it will go to the back of queue 2 and run for 1 more us when it gets the chance
  
  **If there is no statement about preemption, we assume instant preemption.**
